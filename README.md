# Blink Starter for Solana

Blink scaffold Solana acts as a downloadable and reusable template that utilizes NextJS and Tailwind as the front end framework plus API routes for the backend. It comes with all necessary dependencies and configuration out of the box, so that you can immediately start building.

The blink in the starter template showcases a simple donation application that allows users to send SOL (Solana's native currency) to a specified wallet address.
